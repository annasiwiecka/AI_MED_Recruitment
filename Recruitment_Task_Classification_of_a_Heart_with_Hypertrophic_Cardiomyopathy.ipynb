    "I'm going to prepare a solution classification problem of detecting hypertrophic cardiomyopathy based on the provided features. The goal is to build a model capable of correctly distinguishing between a healthy heart and a diseased heart. I'll use: \n",

    "- **Cardiomegaly** :  indicates whether the heart was diagnosed with cardiomegaly:\n",
    "    - 1 – positive diagnosis (diseased heart)\n",
    "    - 0 – negative diagnosis (healthy heart)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Heart width** - The maximum horizontal width of the heart.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lung width** - The horizontal distance between the outermost points of the lungs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inertia tensors** - Metrics describing the distribution of heart and lung pixels relative to the coordinate axes, capturing the shape and orientation of the objects.\n",
    "    - xx – distribution of pixels relative to the y-axis (elongation along x)\n",
    "    - yy – distribution of pixels relative to the x-axis (elongation along y)\n",
    "    - xy – distribution relative to both x and y axes (a high value indicates object rotation)\n",
    "    - normalized_diff – a scalar value derived from the vector whose components are described above\n",

    "- **Inscribed circle radius** - The radius of the largest circle that can be inscribed within the heart area, describing its symmetry and compactness.\n",
